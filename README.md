# deploy

A deployment platform that lets teams ship Azure resources through Terraform
without writing any. Describe an app in a small `.cloud-app.yml` manifest at
the root of its repo; a reusable GitHub Actions workflow translates the
manifest into Terraform and deploys it. Behind the scenes each tool gets a
full stack — Container Apps / Functions / Static Web Apps, Key Vault, optional
database and blob storage — wired together over private networking by default.

## For app teams

Two files in your repo:

```yaml
# .cloud-app.yml
name: orders-api
app:
  port: 8080
database:
  size: small
environments:
  dev: {}
  prod:
    database:
      size: medium
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: deploy
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:
permissions: { contents: read, id-token: write }
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: vgmello/deploy/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@v1
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      plan_only: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
      deploy_ref: v1
```

The trust & identity model — three deploy identities, self/delegated modes, state backends (design implemented and tested; workflow wiring pending): [docs/trust-modes.md](docs/trust-modes.md).

## Manifest at a glance

- `name` + at least one compute section (`app`/`apps`, `functions`, `static_sites`).
- `app:` is shorthand for a single-app repo; `apps:` is a map for several.
- Each app takes a `containers:` map (Terraform `template.container` hierarchy);
  single-container fields (`cpu`, `memory`, `docker`/`image`, `env`, `secrets`)
  are shorthand that folds into `containers.main`.
- `ingress` is `public` / `internal` / `none`, or an object mirroring the
  Terraform ingress block.
- `database.type` is `postgres` (default) or `sqlserver`.
- Everything is private by default; opt out with `public_access: true` or
  `ingress: public`.
- Per-environment overrides live under `environments.<env>` and deep-merge.

## Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python3 -m pytest tests/py            # action logic
terraform -chdir=terraform test       # module logic (offline, mock providers)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs pytest, `terraform validate` + `terraform test`,
a fixture-drift check, `terraform fmt -check`, `tflint`, and actionlint on every
push to `main` and pull request.

> **Status:** the platform is fully built and tested offline, but has not yet
> been run against a live Azure subscription. A landing zone (VNet, subnets,
> private DNS zones, Container Apps environment, ACR, Terraform state storage)
> and per-environment deploy service principals with OIDC federation are
> prerequisites — see `environments/*.yml` and [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).
